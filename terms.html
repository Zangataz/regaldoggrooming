										<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Cancellations and Missed Appointments</h2>
										<p>
										If you’re unable to make your appointment then at least 24 hours’ notice must be given so that I have the opportunity to fill the space.  Should you fail to contact me during this time frame or don’t show up for an appointment then you will be charged full price for the groom you’ve missed.  Payment will then be taken at the time of booking your next appointment.
										</p>
										<p>
										As an independent business I am sure you appreciate the necessity of putting such measures in place and thank you in advance for your co-operation.
										</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Early and Late Arrivals</h2>
										<p>
										All dogs are groomed on a one to one basis.  Careful time management has gone into being able to provide this service - therefore please ensure you arrive on time for your appointment.  If you arrive early, then please wait on the drive.  If you arrive late then I may need to reschedule if I do not have sufficient time to complete the groom before the next dog arrives.  If this is the case, then I will need to treat it as a missed appointment and charge you accordingly (see ‘Cancellations and Missed Appointments’ above).
										</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Matted Coats</h2>
										<p>
										The Animal Welfare Act prohibits me from de-matting coats.  Therefore, matted coats will be clipped off with the appropriate blade length to ensure the dog’s welfare and this may well result in the coat being shorter than desired.  Please be aware that there could be some irritation afterwards and that redness from previous scratching when matted may become visible.
										</p>
										<p>
										Please also note that there may be an additional £5 added to the cost of the groom to help cover the cost of blade sharpening.
										</p>
										
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Fleas</h2>
									<p>
									If fleas are found on your dog, then a flea shampoo may be used.  If this is the case, I recommend you seek veterinary advice and treatment immediately afterwards.  An extra charge of £10 will be added to the cost of the groom to cover the cost of fumigating the salon.
									</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Health and Wellbeing</h2>
									<p>
									During the grooming session all care is taken to ensure the health and wellbeing of your dog.  However, in the event of an emergency I may need to seek the advice of a qualified vet.  Please note that I will not be held responsible for the costs incurred in treating any medical emergency or pre-existing condition.  If I discover what I consider to be a minor medical condition during the groom I will of course bring it to your attention.  However, I am not qualified to give a medical diagnosis and therefore will always suggest you seek the advice of a professional vet.
									</p>
									<p>
									I aim to make the whole experience as positive and relaxing as I can for your dog, but I reserve the right to refuse to groom any dog if I fear for either my or the dog’s safety.  If I have to stop the groom for this reason, then the cost of the full groom or time spent may still apply.  All owners should inform me prior to grooming if their dog has ever bitten or shown aggression at any time.
									</p>
									<p>
									Please ensure your dog has the opportunity to go to the toilet immediately prior to their appointment to avoid accidents in the salon – Thank you!
									</p>
